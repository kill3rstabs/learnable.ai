# Changes Made to Fix Learnable.AI Issues

## Issues Fixed

1. **Mindmap generation and visualization**
   - Added improved error handling in API client
   - Added better data structure validation in the visualization component
   - Fixed response processing in `useProcessing` hook

2. **YouTube URL processing**
   - Completely rewrote the `processYouTubeVideo` function with better error handling
   - Added detailed logging of request/response for debugging
   - Fixed CORS issues by explicitly setting `credentials: 'omit'`

3. **Flashcards rendering**
   - Added data format transformation to handle different API response structures
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Added detection and conversion of different flashcard formats

## Implementation Details

### API Client Improvements
- Added detailed logging throughout the API client
- Improved error handling for better debugging
- Changed fetch credentials from 'include' to 'omit' to avoid CORS issues
- Added better validation of response data

### Frontend Component Improvements
- Enhanced MindmapVisualization component with better error handling
- Modified ResultsSection to handle different data structures
- Added data format transformation for flashcards

### Backend Connection
- Verified CORS configuration in Django settings
- Created test pages and functions to validate API functionality

## Testing
- Created test HTML page to directly test API endpoints
- Added enhanced logging to identify issues
- Verified direct API calls are working correctly

## Further Recommendations
1. Add error boundary components to gracefully handle visualization failures
2. Improve type definitions to better handle API response structures
3. Consider adding retry logic for API calls that might time out
4. Add detailed input validation and clearer error messages
